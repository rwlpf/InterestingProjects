"...
in order to be selected you must me a somewhat known entity. In order to get known as a good speaker, you need to – yeah, you guessed it – speak.
 The newcomers were, in a word, exceptional. With no exception, all of them performed absolutely great. I had the pleasure of attending a session on “soft skills” 
 by Robert French, a gentleman from Scotland. I do a fair amount of speaker mentoring and presentation skill training, so I tend to keep track of small things 
 that can be improved in pretty much every speaker I listen to, but Robert was … as close to absolutely brilliant as I’ve ever seen. I can’t remember the last time 
 I left a session with such a feeling of disbelief due to having watched a master at work. I can’t wait to see him present again, and I sincerely hope the rest 
 of the speaker circuit sit up and take notice, because this man can teach something to EVERYONE. Each of the speakers had one mentor assigned to them, 
 and Robert was paired with the equally brilliant Cathrine Wilhelmsen, so he could not have been in better hands......"

"Hi Robert,

I promised you I would write you some feedback for your wall of facts.

You being open like that has had a massive effect on me and my thinking, exponentionally increasing the expected effects of being a first time speaker. 
Being confronted with yourself doesn't happen easily if you are skilled enough to hide it even from yourself, but you did it.
It has been a pleasure meeting you and seeing your session, I hope you continue to do what you do and that you will touch many lives the way you touched mine.

You are an amazing person and the world is a much better place with you in it.

Kind regards,
Jo"
