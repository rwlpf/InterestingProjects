## Best practices for installing SQL server

As part of a client engagement, I was asked to advise on the installation of SQL Server.  The first task was to establish the client requirements, and we discussed the various options for High Availability and other features.  Once we had agreed on the architecture, the next step was to install the three instances of SQL Server, Dev, UAT, and Production.  Before proceeding to install the software, a best practice document, which had several parts, was created.
The first section of the document had several tasks which the hosting company was required to complete and confirm had been carried out. 
 The next section, recorded the which were complete as part of the installation of SQL server which was carried out me. The completed document was passed to the client.  So they had a record of the tasks and the reasons for carrying out the task.
The a sample of the doucments can be found [here.](https://github.com/rwlpf/InterestingProjects/tree/main/Eyecademy/SQL%20Server%20Installation%20Best%20Practices) 

Our commerical team was speaking to a major public sector organisation in Glasgow.  During the meetings with my colleagues they mentioned wanting assistance with data story telling.  There was a dataset which I had been working about potholes in Glasgow.  Working with my fellow consultants we were able to generate a data story.  At a subsquent meeting with the client, a colleague and myself presented a data story to the client.  This is an article with a link to a recording of the data story presented and a link to the Power BI report used.

## Bit of query optimisation
Whilst working with a client, I was doing some work on SSIS packages for them.  Typically these are several TSQL statements executed as part of the package to perform various tasks.   Part of the process was to review how long the package took to run.  When I checked the package had taken 10 hours to run, which did seem like a very long time.  Next, I decided to review the individual queries.  There was two which took a long time, 4 hours and 1.5 hours respectively.  After reviewing the queries, then making some changes, both queries ran in less than 1min and 30 seconds.  As a previous line manager often said to some developers, never use a function in a join and watch out for implicate data conversions in the joins.
# Webinars
During a discussion with the marketing department, one, suggestion that I made was to record some webinars.  These would be about one of my favourite topics which is data.  After recording the first one, I was keen to engage with other members of the team.  There were several reasons for this.  Rather than looking like I was the only consultant on the team, involving others meant our clients and customers could see a much larger group.  Another reason is that I would be working as part of a team, so we could generate better ideas, and consider other approaches. 
Below is a list of the webinars that were recorded and published to YouTube.

## Set of blog posts on Power Bi Licencing
My line manager sent an email to the consulting team, asking some general questions about PowerBI licensing.  After my "short" draft response had reached, six paragraphs and that I felt there was more to cover.  The idea popped into my head to write a set of blog posts outlining my knowledge on this subject.  These blogs could then form a reference document for my colleagues and ensure our customers knew we had the expertise to answer their questions.  After some more research, I then recorded a webinar to cover the material and some other information that I discovered.
